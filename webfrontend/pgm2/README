See the main doc (fhem.html) for the first documentation and installation.

If you want to show anly a part of your devices on a single screen
(i.e divide them into separate rooms), then assign each device the
room attribute in the config file:

  attr ks300     room garden
  attr ks300-log room garden

The attribute of the FHZ device will be used as title on the first
screen, which shows the list of all rooms. Devices in the room
"hidden" will not be shown. Devices without a room attribute go
to the room "misc".

To configure the absicondir and relicondir correctly, look into the
httpd.conf file (probably /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf), and check the
line which looks like:
 Alias /icons/ "/home/httpd/icons/"
relicondir will then be /icons, and absicondir /home/httpd/icons.
