- Rudi, Thu Feb  1 13:27:15 MET 2007
  Created the file HISTORY and the file README.DEV

- Pest, Thu Feb  1 20:45 MET 2007
  Added description for attribute ,

- Rudi, Sun Feb 11 18:56:05 MET 2007
  - showtime added for pgm2 (useful for FS20 piri display)
  - defattr command added, it makes easier to assign room, type, etc for a group
    of devices.
  - em1010.pl added to the contrib directory. It seems that we are able
    to read out the EM1010PC. Not verified with multiple devices.

- Pest, Thu Feb 11 23:35 MET 2007
  - Added doc/linux.html (multiple USDB devices, udev links)
  - Linked fhem.html and commandref.html to linux.html

- Martin Haas, Fri Feb 23 10:18 MET 2007
  - ARM-Section (NSLU2) added to doc/linux.html

- Pest, Sat Feb 24 18:30 MET 2007
  - doc/linux.html: Module build re-written.

- Rudi, Sun Mar  4 11:18:10 MET 2007
  Reorganization. Goal: making attribute adding/deleting more uniform
  (,
  possible (i.e. saving the configfile, list of possible devices etc).

  Internal changes:
  - %logmods,%devmods moved to %modules. Makes things more uniform
  - %logs merged into %defs
  - local state info (%readings) changed to global ($defs{$d}{READINGS})
    -> No need for the listfn function in each module
    -> User written scripts can more easily analyze device states

  User visible changes:
  - at/notify ,
    modules. Now it is possible
    - to have a further ,
      (notify & filelog use the same interface)
    - to have more than one notify for the same event
    - to delete at commands without strange escapes.
      The delete syntax changed (no more def/at/ntfy needed)
    - at/notify can have attributes
    Drawback: each at and notify must have a name, which is strange first.
  - logfile/modpath/pidfile/port/verbose ,
    Dumping and extending these attributes is easier, no special handling
    required in the web-frontend.
  - savefile renamed to ,
  - configfile global attribute added.
  - save command added, it writes the statefile and then the configfile.
  - delattr added to delete single attributes
  - list/xmllist format changed, they contain more information.
  - ,
    in the same format. This data is contained in the xmllist.
  - disable attribute for at/notify/filelog
  - rename added

- Rudi, Tue Mar 27 20:43:15 MEST 2007
  fhemweb.pl (webpgm2) changes:
  - adopted to the new syntax
  - better commandline support (return <pre> formatted)
  - FileLog attribute logtype added, and 4 logtypes (== gnuplot files)
    defined: fs20, fht, ks300_1, ks300_2
  - links in the commandref.html file added
  - device dependent attribute and set support

- Pest, Sun Apr 08 17:55:15 MEST 2007
  em1010.pl:
  - Make difference between sensors 1..4 and 5..
  - Checked values for sensor 5 (cur.energy + cur.power) - ok
  - Checked values for sensor 5 cur.energy is ok, cur.power still off.
    Correction factor needs to be determined.
  - setTime: Without argument, now the current time of the PC is used.
  - setRperKW: Factor of 10 required, 75 U/kWh -> 750.

- Pest, Tue Apr 10 20:31:22 MEST 2007

    One step closer for complete fhem on the FritzBox.

- Boris Sun Jan 06 13:35:00 CET 2008
  - bugfix: 62_EMEM.pm:  changed reading energy_total_kWh to energy_kWh_w,

    from device
  - minor changes in fhem.html

- Rudi Tue Jan  8 21:13:08 MET 2008
  - feature: attr global allowfrom <ip-adresses/hostnames>
    If set, only connects from these addresses are allowed. This is to
    "simulate" a little bit of security.

- Rudi Sat Jan 19 18:04:12 MET 2008
  - FHT: multiple commands
    Up to 8 commands in one set, these are transmitted at once to the FHT
  - softbuffer changes
    minfhtbuffer attribute, as otherwise nearly everything will be sent to
    the FHT buffer, so ordering won't take effect.
  - cmd rename
    report1,report2. refreshvalues changed to report1 and report2. refreshvalues
    won't be advertized but still replaced with "report1 255 report2 255"
  - extensive documentation update for the FHT

    commands added.

- Rudi Sun Jan 27 18:12:42 MET 2008

- Rudi Fri May  9 20:00:00 MEST 2008
  - feature: FHEM modules may live on a filesystem with "ignorant" casing (FAT)
    If you install FHEM on a USB-Stick (e.g. for the FritzBox) it may happen
    that the filename casing is different from the function names inside the file.
    -> Fhem won't find the <module>_Initialize function. Fixed by searching all
    function-names for a match with "ignore-case"
  - feature: FileLog function "set reopen" impemented. In case you want to delete some
    wrong entries from a current logfile, you must tell fhem to reopen the file again
  - feature: multiline commands are supported through the command line
    Up till now multiline commands were supported only by "include". Now they
    are supprted from the (tcp/ip) connection too, so they can be used by the
    web frontends.
  - feature: pgm2 installation changes, multiple instances, external css
    pgm2 (FHEMWEB) is now a "real" fhem module:
    - the configuration takes place via attributes
    - the css file is external, and each FHEMWEB instance can use its own set
    - the default location for pictures, gnuplot scripts and css is the FHEM
      module directory
    - multiline support for notify and at scripts.
    - feature: FileLog "set reopen" for manual tweaking of logfiles.
      - feature: multiline commands are supported through the command line
        - feature: pgm2 installation changes, multiple instances, external css
