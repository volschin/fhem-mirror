- Rudi, Sun Feb 11 18:56:05 MET 2007
  - showtime added for pgm2 (useful for FS20 piri display)
  - defattr command added, it makes easier to assign room, type, etc for a group
    of devices.
  - em1010.pl added to the contrib directory. It seems that we are able
    to read out the EM1010PC. Not verified with multiple devices.

- Pest, Thu Feb 11 23:35 MET 2007
  - Added doc/linux.html (multiple USDB devices, udev links)
  - Linked fhem.html and commandref.html to linux.html

- Martin Haas, Fri Feb 23 10:18 MET 2007
  - ARM-Section (NSLU2) added to doc/linux.html

  - doc/linux.html: Module build re-written.

- Rudi, Sun Mar  4 11:18:10 MET 2007
  Reorganization. Goal: making attribute adding/deleting more uniform
  ("at/notify" and other device differences), and making web-configuration
  possible (i.e. saving the configfile, list of possible devices etc).

  Internal changes:
  - %logmods,%devmods moved to %modules. Makes things more uniform
  - %logs merged into %defs
  - local state info (%readings) changed to global ($defs{$d}{READINGS})
    -> No need for the listfn function in each module
    -> User written scripts can more easily analyze device states

  User visible changes:
  - at/notify "renamed" to "define <name> at/notify", both moved to external
    modules. Now it is possible
    - to have a further "at" or "notify" modules
      (notify & filelog use the same interface)
    - to have more than one notify for the same event
    - to delete at commands without strange escapes.
      The delete syntax changed (no more def/at/ntfy needed)
    - at/notify can have attributes
    Drawback: each at and notify must have a name, which is strange first.
  - logfile/modpath/pidfile/port/verbose "renamed" to "attr global xxx"
    Dumping and extending these attributes is easier, no special handling
    required in the web-frontend.
  - savefile renamed to "attr global statefile"
  - configfile global attribute added.
  - save command added, it writes the statefile and then the configfile.
  - delattr added to delete single attributes
  - list/xmllist format changed, they contain more information.
  - "define/set/get/attr name ?" returns a list of possible arguments
    in the same format. This data is contained in the xmllist.
  - disable attribute for at/notify/filelog
  - rename added

- Rudi, Tue Mar 27 20:43:15 MEST 2007
  fhemweb.pl (webpgm2) changes:
  - adopted to the new syntax
  - better commandline support (return <pre> formatted)
  - FileLog attribute logtype added, and 4 logtypes (== gnuplot files)
    defined: fs20, fht, ks300_1, ks300_2
  - links in the commandref.html file added
  - device dependent attribute and set support

- Pest, Sun Apr 08 17:55:15 MEST 2007
  em1010.pl:
  - Make difference between sensors 1..4 and 5..
  - Checked values for sensor 5 (cur.energy + cur.power) - ok
  - Checked values for sensor 5 cur.energy is ok, cur.power still off.
    Correction factor needs to be determined.
  - setTime: Without argument, now the current time of the PC is used.
  - setRperKW: Factor of 10 required, 75 U/kWh -> 750.

- Pest, Tue Apr 10 20:31:22 MEST 2007
  em1010.pl:

  final documentations, release 4.0. Tagged as FHEM_4_0

- Pest, Sat Apr 14 14:21:00 MEST 2007

  - doc: fhem.pl and commandref.html (notifyon -> notify, correction of examples)

- Rudi, Tue Apr 24 08:10:43 MEST 2007
  - feature: modify command added. It helps change e.g. only the time component
    for an at command, without deleting and creating it again and then
    reapplying all the attributes.
  - feature: the "-" character is disallowed in defined names. Use dot (.) or _
    instead.  The - is used to separate ranges in the set command.

- Rudi, Sun May 27 12:51:52 MEST 2007
  - Archiving FileLogs. Added fhemweb.pl (pgm2) code, to show logs from the
    archive directory. See the attributes archivedir/archivecmd.
