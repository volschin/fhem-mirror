# If at the weekly lime-protection time (usually saturday at 11:00 AM) the
# desired temperature is lower than the measured temperature, then you'll get
# instead of "actuator:0%" the "actuator:lime-protection" messsages every 2.5
# minutes.  I think this is an FHT80b firmware bug, a workaround is to set the
# desired temperature for a short time higher than the measured temperature.
# You can automate it (for all FHT's) with the following notify:

define lime_reset notify .*lime-protection {\
  my $d = $defs{@}{READINGS}{"desired-temp"}{VAL};;\
  my $m = $defs{@}{READINGS}{"measured-temp"}{VAL};;\
  if($m > $d) {\
    fhem("set @ desired-temp 29");;\
    fhem("set @ desired-temp $d");;\
  }\
