<h1><a href="fhem.html">FHEM</a> on the Fritz!Box 7390</h1>

(as of 2011-07-08)
<br><br>

    AVM released after the CeBIT 2011 an image for the Fritz!Box7390 containing
    fhem, see <a href="http://www.avm.de/de/Service/Service-Portale/Labor/index.php"
    >this</a> link. This image is to be installed in <i>addition</i> to the
    normal firmware.  In order to use the image, you have to install a Lab
    version of the normal firmware before, because fhem needs the USB-Serial
    kernel modules in order to talk to the CUL, and these are not yet part of
    the "normal" firmware.<br>

    Version 19798 of this fhem-image (not the Lab firmware) configures 2 CUL
    devices, the first one talking FS20, the second preconfigured for
    HomeMatic. Autoconfigure is not enabled by default, so you'll either have
    to enable it or to enter the devices by hand.  <br><br>

    The bad news with this fhem-image is, that it will start fhem in a chroot
    environment, i.e. you will not be able to trigger arbitrary FritzBox
    functions out of fhem, e.g. sending mail, enabling WLAN, etc.<br><br>

    <br><br>

    <a href="fhem-=VERS=-fb7390.image">This</a> fhem-image contains a stripped
    down version of the perl package from the AVM fhem-image, a current version
    of fhem, and a modified installation script. The main difference is
    starting fhem in a normal (non-chroot) environment, and enabling
    autocreate.<br><br>

    When installing it, you have to confirm with an extra click that it does
    not have a valid AVM signature. It will reuse your old logfiles and
    configuration, unlike the "original" AVM firmware. Autocreate is on, and
    there are NO CUL devices defined in the initial configuration, you'll have
    to do this manually, e.g. by following the HOWTO or the command reference.
    <br><br>

    Further bad news for both versions: Currently the only working serial
    kernel driver is the cdc_acm, which means only the CUL can be attached
    directly to the FritzBox. The FHZ1x00 needs the ftdi_sio driver, which
    currently panics the FritzBox. If I am informed correctly, then this
    problem will be solved in the near future.<br>
    Of course you can always use devices attached via network, like the CUN.
