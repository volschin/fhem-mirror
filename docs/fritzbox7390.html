<h3>Description for the Fritzbox 7390</h3>
<ul>
    AVM released after the CeBIT 2011 a "firmware" image containing fhem, see <a
    href="http://www.avm.de/de/Service/Service-Portale/Labor/7390_hausautomation/labor_start_hausautomation.php">this</a>
    link. This is to be installed in addition to the normal firmware.  In order
    to use this version, you have to install a Lab version of the "normal"
    firmware first, because we need the USB-Serial kernel modules in order to
    talk to the CUL and the "Lab" firmware also contains a hook in order to
    start fhem. 
    <br>
    Version 19798 of this firmware configures 2 CUL devices, the first one
    talking FS20, the second preconfigured for HomeMatic. Autoconfigure is not
    enabled by default, so you'll either have to enable it or to enter the
    devices by hand.
    <br><br>
    The bad news with this version is, that it will start fhem in a chroot
    environment, i.e. you will not be able to use arbitrary FritzBox functions
    out of fhem.
    <br><br>

    <a href="fhem-5.1.rc1.fb7390.image">This</a> firmware image is a modified
    version of the AVM original firmware, as it will not start fhem in a chroot
    jail. I also cleaned up the perl distribution, so it is some 30
    uncompressed MB smaller than the original.
    <br>
    When installing it, you have to confirm with an extra click that it does
    not have a valid AVM signature. It will reuse your old logfiles and
    configuration, unlike the "original" AVM firmware. Autoconfigure is on, and
    there are NO CUL devices defined in the initial configuration, you'll have
    to do this manually, e.g. by following the HOWTO or the command reference.
    <br><br>

    Further bad news for both versions: Currently the only working serial
    kernel driver is the cdc_acm, which means only the CUL can be attached
    directly to the FritzBox. The FHZ1x00 needs the ftdi_sio driver, which
    currently panics the FritzBox.<br> Alternatively you can use devices
    attached via network, like the CUN.
