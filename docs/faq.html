<h2>FHEM FAQ</h2>

<b>I get "undefined" messages in the log after upgrading fhem.pl</b>
<ul>
   Stop fhem.pl, delete the previous .save file and restart fhem.pl.
   If the problem still exists, send a bugreport.
</ul>

<b>I switched on a FS20 device directly (without the remote), but
   the fhem.pl did not noticed it.<br>Is it a bug?</b>
<ul>
   The protocol used by the FS20 family is quite simple: it is </b>not</b>
   encrypted in any way, and there is no feedback to the sender.  So if you
   push any buttons on a pure receiver, no radio waves will be sent out, and
   the FHZ1000 won't notice anything. The FHZ1000PC does not even know if
   somebody received its message, it simply sends it out 3 times and hopes
   for good luck.<br>
   To answer the question: it is not a bug :-)
</ul>

<b>I have some FS20/FHT/HMS devices.<br>
   How do I know their housecode?</b><br>
<ul>
   If you already programmed some devices, then just start fhem.pl with one
   of the example configuration files, and watch the log.  When activating a
   deivce (e.g. with the remote) then it will be logged as an unknown device
   with the housecode. Note: the verbose level must be 3 or higher.  KS300
   devices do not have a proper code, so you can use anything.
</ul>

<b>I have the code for my devices in the ELV notation, which contains 1,2,3 and
   4, but you require a hex code.<br>
   How should I convert it?</b>
<ul>
   The code used by ELV is in the "quaternal" (?) system plus one added to each
   digit, so you can even use the 4 button remote for programming. To convert,
   you have two choices: the program four2hex in the contrib directory, or the
   good old unix program bc.
   <ul>
     <li>From  quaternal (ELV Remote) to hex (fhem.pl):<br>
	 <pre>
	 % bc
	 obase=16
	 ibase=4
	 &lt;elv number&gt;</pre>
	 where &lt;elv number&gt; is the number used on the remote, but 1
	 substracted from every digit (so each digit is between 0 and 3).</li>

     <li>From hex (fhem.pl) to quaternal (ELV Remote):<br>
	 <pre>
         % bc
	 ibase=16
	 obase=4
	 &lt;hex number&gt;</pre>
	 Now add 1 to each digit of the result, and prepend it with 1's if
	 it has less than 4 digits.</li> </ul>


</ul>

<b>I replaced my FHZ1X00PC, now the FHT80b's does not work anymore.<br>
Help me!</b>
<ul>
   The FHT80b's are talking to a single FHZ1XXX device, which has a unique
   "FHTcode". You have two choices: if you know the old FHTcode, then you can
   set it,  or you can tell the FHT80b to forget the old FHZ, and start talking
   with the new one.
   <ul>
     <li>Set the FHTcode: The problem with this method is that I don't know how
     to read out the value, we just can change it with<br>
     <code>set FHZ FHTcode &lt;hex-code&gt;</code></li>
     <li>Resync the FHT80b: Press PROG until "Sond" appears, then select "CEnt"
     with the wheel, press PROG again, Select "nA" with the wheel, press PROG
     again.</li>

   </ul>
</ul>

<b>I can specify an optional ml/raincounter for a KS300.<br>
Why do you think that 255 should be the default?</b>
<ul>
   The manual talks about 0.3l resolution, but I wanted to calibrate my device.
   So I filled a plastic bottle with 0.5 liter water from the measuring cup,
   drilled a small hole in the bottom of the bottle, let the water flow slowly
   in the KS300 rain-cup, and looked at the counter after the bottle was empty.<br>

   The raincounter was incremented by 130 ticks. The diameter of my KS300
   rain-cup is 13.9 cm, the area ca 151.75 cm<sup>2</sup>, which
   is ca 1/65.9 m<sup>2</sup>.
   The 0.5 liter corresponds to 32.95 liter per m<sup>2</sup>. 130 ticks
   correspond to 32.95 l/m<sum>2</sup> -> 1 tick is ca 253 ml. I estimate
   the error margin to +/- 2%<br>

   You are welcome to do your own experiments, I am interested in the results.
</ul>

<b>The time specification of the builtin at command is not very flexible.<br>
Please add day/month/weekday to it.</b>
<ul>
  I think the command is complex and flexible enough. Use a perl expression
  for this functionality like (described in the commandref.html):
  <pre>at *07:00:00 { fhz "set lamp on" if($we) }</pre>
</ul>


<b>I defined my FS20STR as an FHT device, but I do not get any data from it.</b>
<ul>
   The FS20STR is an FS20 device, even if it looks like an FHT80b.
   You'll get "only" on-for-timer and off-for-timer events sent.
</ul>

<b>How to convert the FHT8b code seen in its display to the hex code needed by fhem.pl?</b>
<ul>
   Convert the first 2 digits first from decimal to hex, then the next two. Example:<br>
	 <pre>
         % bc
	 set obase=16
	 &lt;first two digits&gt;
	 &lt;last two digits&gt;</pre>
   E.g The FHT8b code 1121 is 0b15 for the fhem.pl
</ul>

<b>I'd like to use this sunrise/sunset stuff, can you help me?</b>
<ul>
   First you (most probably) have to install the DateTime::Event::Sunrise perl
   module, as it is not part of the standard distributions. If it is not
   installed and you copy the contrib/99_SUNRISE.pm into your module (FHEM)
   directory, then the program will not start up, telling you that this module
   is missing.
   The (IMHO) easiest way to install it is via the following command (probably
   as root):<br>
   <pre>
   perl -MCPAN -e shell
   cpan> install DateTime::Event::Sunrise</pre>
   This will fetch the module from a CPAN archive, compile it and install it,
   and will do the same with each perl module which is needed by this one.<br>
   
   Next look for the geographic coordinates of your home, e.g with a GPS
   receiver or with googleearth. Compute the latitude/longitude as needed, and
   enter them in your init file (fhem.cfg) with the command:
   <pre>{sunrise_coord("<latitude>", "<longitude>", "Europe/Berlin") }</pre>
   If you are living in a different timezone, then change the string above
   according to the <code>perldoc DateTime</code> manpage.<br>

   Now copy the contrib/99_SUNRISE.pm file into your module directory, and
   restart the program. If everything is ok, typing
   <pre>{ sunrise_abs() }</pre>
   in the telnet prompt, will return the time of the sunrise today, in a
   HH:MM:SS format.
</ul>
