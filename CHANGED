- 2005-10-27 (1.3)
  - Bugfix: multiple at commands at the same time.

- 2005-11-10 (1.4)
  - Reformatting the package and the documentation
  - New links

- 2005-12-26 (1.5)
  - "modularized" in preparation for the FHT80B -> each device has a type
  - added relative "at" commands (with +HH:MM:SS)
  - multiple commands on one line separated with ;
  - sleeping 0.22 seconds after an ST command
  - some commands/syntax changed:
    - switch => set
    - device => fhzdevice
    - define <name> ... => define <name> <type> ...
  - the state of the devices and the at commands are saved
  - at start always sending a "set 0001 00 01" to enable the FHZ receiever.
    This is a workaround.
  - doc rewrite, examples directory

- 2006-01-03 (1.6)
  - signal handling (to save the state on shutdown)
  - module FHZ addded (for the FHZ1000PC device itself)
  - added the get function (to make the initialization prettier)
  - the module ST was renamed to FS20
  - FS20 timer commands added
  - modules command removed (we are loading everything from the modpath
    directory)
  - FHT80b module added (yes, it is already useful, you can set
    and view a lot of values)
  - documentation adapted
  - Added a TODO file

- 2006-01-04 (1.7)
  - the at command can be used to execute something repeatedly with *
  - ntfy can filter on device or on device+event with a regexp
  - checking the delete and notify regexps if they make sense
  - the FHT init string is now a set command (refreshvalues)
  - shutdown saves the detailed device information too

- 2006-01-05 (1.8)
  - Bugfix: detailed FS20 status was not set from external event
  - Bugfix: setstate for FS20 returned the last state set
  - Bugfix: undefined FS20 devices (can) crash the server
  - HMS module added by Martin Mueller
    (currently supporting the HMS100T & HMS100TF)
  - Log modules added, the first one being a simple FileLog
    (inspired by Martin Mueller)
  - A little  gnuplot script to display temperature and actuator changes

- 2006-02-10 (1.9)
  (aka as the Juergen release)
  - The FHZ1300 is reported to work
  - Bugfix: spaces before comment in the config file should be ignored
  - added FS20STR codes to 10_FS20.pm
  - names restricted to A-Za-z0-9.:- (especially _ is not allowed)
  - delete calles now an UndefFn in the module
  - implementation of FS20 function group/local master/global master
  - the list command tells you the definition of the device too

- 2006-02-12 (1.9a)
  - Bugfix: wrong rights for HMS and wrong place for readonly
    (thanks to Juergen)

- 2006-02-12 (1.9b)
  - Bugfix: Fixing the same bug again (thanks to Martin)

- 2006-04-02 (2.0)
  - XmlList and webfrontend/pgm1 programs from Raoul Matthiessen
  - list tries to display the state and not the last command
  - Both log facilities (FileLog and Log) take wildcards
    (week, year, month, etc) to make logfile rotating easier
  - webfrontend/pgm2

- 2006-04-15 (2.1)
  - webfrontend/pgm2 changes:
    - make it work on Asus dsl-routers (no "use warnings")
    - css/readonly configurable
    - Formatting for HMS data
  - comments can be added to each device (setstate <dev> comment:xxx)
  - testbed to dry-test functionality (test directory)
  - added an empty hull for the KS300 weather module
  - added undocumented "exec" function to call arbitrary program parts
    for debugging. Example: exec FhzDecode("81xx04xx0101a0011234030011");
  - webfrontend/pgm3, contributed by Martin Haas
  - fixed pgm1: changing values should work now

- 2006-05-20 (2.2)
  - FHZ1300 support verified (+ doc changes)
  - KS300 support added (with Temperature, Humidity, Wind speed, Rain).
    Not verified/undecoded: subzero temp, weak battery, Is-raining flag,
    wind speed > 100km/h
  - webpgm2 log fix for "offed" FHT devices (with no actuator data)
  - webpgm3 upgrade (by Martin Haas, see webpgm/pgm3/docs/CHANGES for details)
  - HMS logging/state format changed to make it similar to KS300
  - added HMS100WD (thanks to Sascha Pollok)
  - ntfy/logging changed to be able to notify for multiple attributes
    arriving in one message
  - central FHTcode settable (see commandref.html)
  - optionally listen for non-local requests (port <num> global)
  - unknown logging
  - FAQ

- 2006-6-22 (2.3)
  - CRC checking (i.e. ignoring messages with bad CRC, message on verbose 4)
  - contrib/checkmesg.pl added to check message consistency (debugging)
  - FHT: unknown_aa, unknown_ba codes added. What they are for?
  - Empty modpath / no modpath error messages added (some user think modpath is
    superfluous)
  - Unparsed messages (verbose 5) now printed as hex
  - Try to reattach to the usb device if it disappears: no need to
    restart the server if the device is pulled out from the USB socket and
    plugged in again (old versions go into a busy loop here).
  - Supressing the seldom (ca 1 out of 700) short KS300 messages.
    (not sure how to interpret them)
  - Added KS300 "israining" status flag. Note: this not always triggers when it
    is raining, but there seems to be a correlation. To be evaluated in more
    detail.
  - notifyon can now execute "private" perl code as well (updated
    commandref.html, added the file example/99_PRIV.pm)
  - another "perl code" example is logging the data into the database
    (with DBI), see the file contrib/91_DbLog.pm. Tested with an Oracle DB.
  - logs added to the xmllist
  - FHT80b: Fix measured-temp over 25.5 (handling the tempadd messages better)

- 2006-07-23 (2.4)
  - contrib/four2hex (to convert between ELV and our codes) by Peter Stark
  - make dist added to set version (it won't work in a released version)
  - reload function to reload (private) perl modules
  - 20_FHT.pm fix: undef occures once without old data
  - "setstate comment" is replaced with the attr command (i.e. attribute).
    The corresponding xmllist COMMENT tag is replaced with the ATTR tag.
    Devices or logs can have attr definitions.
  - webfrontend/pgm2 (fhzweb.pl) updated to handle "room" attributes(showing
    only devices in this room).
  - version 0.4.2 of webfrontend/pgm3 integrated.
  - contrib/ks300avg.pl to compute daily and monthly avarage values.
  - the 40_KS300.pm module is computing daily and monthly avarages for the
    temp/hum and wind values and sum of the rain. The cum_day and cum_month
    state variables are used as helper values.  To log the avarage use the
    .*avg.* regexp. The regexp for the intraday log will trigger it also.
  - Added the contrib file garden.pl as a more complex example: garden
    irrigation. The program computes the time for irrigation from the avarage
    temperature reported by the ks300-2.
  - Enable uppercase hex codes (Bug reported by STefan Mayer)
  - Renamed the unknown_XX FHT80b codes to code_XXXXXX, this will produce
    "Undefined type" messages when reading the old save file
  - RM100-2 added (thanks for the codes from andikt).

- 2006-08-13 (2.5)
  Special thanks to STefan Mayer for a lot of suggestions and bug reports
  - If a command is enclosed in {}, then it will be evaluated as a perl
    expression, if it is enclosed in "" then it is a shell command, else it is
    a "normal" fhz1000 command.
    "at" and "notifyon" follow this convention too.
    Note: a shell command will always be issued in the background.
  - won't die anymore if the at spec contains an unknown command
  - rereadcfg added. Sending a HUP should work better now
  - escaping % and @ in the notify argument is now possible with %% or @@
  - new command trigger to test notify commands
  - where you could specify an fhz command, now you can specify a list of
    them, separated by ";". Escape is ;;
  - KS300 sometimes reports "negative" rain when it begins to rain.  Filter
    such values. israining is set when the raincounter changed or the ks300
    israining bit is set.
  - sleep command, with millisecond accuracy
  - HMS 100MG support by Peter Stark.
  - Making FHT and FS20 messages more uniform
  - contrib/fs20_holidays.sh by STefan Mayer
    (simulate presence while on holiday)
